                        <p>
                        I've studied game design, art, and programming. I love all three of those knowledge bases. I am passionate about learning, I am ever curious, constantly looking for ways to improve the world around me, and I find joy in the simplest of things. Some of my favorite things to do are read books, play video games, watch anime and movies of all kinds, draw, write, and in general create. I enjoy problem solving and creative solutions which is why this site even came to be in the first place. If you are looking for a creative web developer, designer with technical aptitude, and or an artist that understands technical requirements reach out to me and we'll collaborate to achieve the solutions your business needs.

                        I worked with my team to ensure that the codebase for Madden 2018 was stable as features were added and fixes checked in. This involved reviewing bot and automation results which were tests for primary player paths. Reporting test results, analyzing issues, documenting bugs, assigning bugs to developers, and working in tandem to assist developers with bug diagnosis and fixes were some of my daily tasks.

                        Coursework was intensive and invovled three compentencies; Art, design, and programming. I focused on art but the program instructs all students with expectation that you learn and have at least an intermediate mastery and understanding of all three areas.
